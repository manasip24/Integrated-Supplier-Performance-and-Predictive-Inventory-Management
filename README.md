# Inventory Management & Predictive Analytics
Enhancing Inventory Management with Predictive Analytics 

This repository contains code and resources for a project focusing on developing a comprehensive model for predicting stockouts, evaluating supplier performance, and enhancing inventory management and restocking procedures.


**Proposal**
The objective is to develop a comprehensive model that accurately predicts stockouts while evaluating supplier performance to enhance inventory management and restocking procedures. With retail industries facing the dual challenge of maintaining optimal stock levels and ensuring supplier quality, our research stands to deliver significant value by minimizing stockouts and associated costs. The integration of machine learning and advanced statistical methods promises a dynamic solution adaptable to real-time data and market conditions.


**Research Questions**
1. How can we predict stockout events based on sales velocity and current inventory levels?
2. What is the impact of supplier reliability on inventory management, and how can it inform reorder thresholds?
3. How do seasonal demand patterns and local events affect inventory requirements?
4. In what ways can machine learning algorithms enhance the accuracy of our predictive models over time?


**Dataset**

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Data.gov. It contains information on warehouse and retail sales, which is essential for training and validating the predictive models.

**Code**

The code provided in this repository is written in R and addresses various aspects of the project:
1. Loading and preprocessing the dataset.
2. Predicting stockout events using logistic regression.
3. Evaluating the impact of supplier reliability on retail sales.
4. Analyzing seasonal demand patterns.
5. Implementing predictive modeling for retail stockouts.

   
**Instructions**
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have R installed along with necessary packages like tidyverse, lubridate, ggplot2, randomForest, and caret.
3. Run the code files in sequential order to execute different components of the project.
4. Customize the code and models according to your specific requirements and dataset characteristics.
